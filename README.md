## Case Study: CI/CD Pipeline for FastAPI and AWS Lambda Applications
### Objective

Create a CI/CD pipeline for two Python applications: a `FastAPI` application and an `AWS Lambda function.` Deploy these applications in a brand new AWS account. The FastAPI application must be publicly accessible, and the AWS Lambda function should be scheduled to run every hour.

### Requirements
- Dockerized both applications
- Use Terraform to create the infrastructure
- Use GitHub Actions to deploy the applications
- Deploy FastAPI application in an ECS service
- Deploy AWS Lambda function in the same VPC as the ECS service

### How to submit
- Create a new repository in your GitHub account
- Send us the link to the repository
- Provide documentation on how to deploy the applications
- You have one week to complete the Case study
